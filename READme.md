Smart HealthCare System

Task 04:
1) First i imported all the libraries like tensorflow, keras and used ImageDataGenerator for loading the image and also used matplotlib for ploting the graphs
2) I did the code in google colab and uploaded all the required files(like dataset and test_img in it)
3) Then i loaded dataset using ImageDataGenerator
4) Then i splitted the dataset into train and test(validation)  [80-20]
5) Next i build the CNN model in which i did pooling which reduces spatial size and also built the dense layer at the end map to binary output via sigmoid
6) Training the dataset using the built model then plotted it using matplotlib
7) Evaluated the test_img and got the score
